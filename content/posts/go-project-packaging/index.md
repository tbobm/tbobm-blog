List things I like to use or do when working with go

## Why go ?

I recently celebrated more than 10 years of doing Python, from scripting,
working on high volume event processing application to media processing.

Romance with go dates back to 2016, learned that it was blazing fast, strongly
typed and that great projects (wink wink Kubernetes) were built using this language
built by folks at Google.

- why I like go for that even if I did python for years and years
  - challenge
  - portability
  - cloud native integrations -> little to no overhead / warmup
  - performances
- release lifecycle
  - semantic versioning
  - goreleaser
  - asdf version management
- packages
  - logs: logrus / slog
  - CLI: spf13 suite (cobra, viper, pflags)
