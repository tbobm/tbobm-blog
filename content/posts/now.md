Current topics I work on and main interests.

I love to post stuff on Github and a lot of my stuff is public: [github.com/tbobm][gh-tbobm]

## TLDR

I like to work with highly scalable, efficient and reliable architectures (ideally by building them).
Most of my recent experiences have been focused on Media Processing, offering a nice sandbox to try
out Event Driven architectures.

Coding is now a great part of my day to day life, with a strong intention to write
self maintainable code, easy to ready and most importantly, simple things that just work.

## Cloud (Native) stuff

Working in Cloud, infra and Devops is my thing, even if I always like to write code.

Most of my energy go towards the following aeras of interest

- AWS
    - Put together event driven, resiliant, highly scalable architectures
    - Develop serverless components
    - Creating golang based cloud services

- Kubernetes
    - Maintaining existing legacy clusters
    - Supporting engineers in improving Kubernetes cluster ownership
    - Advising people to use it only when it's the most suited tool


_Scaleway has a special place in my heart but I just don't have the occasion to play around
with them at this time._


## Sharing knowledge

- Doing more public speaking
- Getting a nice rythm with this blog

## Automating all the things

A few fun stuff I did in the past:
- [tbobm/gha-dynamic-containers][gh-dynamic]: dynamic github matrix creation with container image discovery
- [tbobm/apps][gh-apps]: hello world components to troubleshoot systems (implementation of dynamix matrixes)
- [tbobm/etna-uptime][gh-etna-uptime]: static statuspage for uptime monitoring based on github actions (from [upptime][gh-upptime])
